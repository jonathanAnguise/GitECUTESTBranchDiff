GitECUTESTBranchDiff is a simple and efficient script designed to simplify the process of comparing two branches in ECU-TEST, an automotive software testing tool. This script helps identify modified files between the local branch and another branch, copies these files to a temporary folder, and allows you to open them directly in ECU-TEST's native compare tool.


## üßê Features    
Quickly identify files modified between the local branch and another branch
Automatically copy these files to a temporary folder for easy access
Easily open the copied files with the native ECU-TEST compare tool (Note: This feature may **not work with ECU-TEST 2023.1 version**, so I still **have not implemented** it)
        
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To use GitECUTESTBranchDiff, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the GitECUTESTBranchDiff repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanAnguise/GitECUTESTBranchDiff.git
```

2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x GitECUTESTBranchDiff/GitECUTESTBranchDiff.sh
```

## üßëüíª Usage
To compare branches in ECU-TEST, run the script with the following command:

```bash
./GitECUTESTBranchDiff.sh path branch_to_compare
```

Replace path with the desired path to store the temporary files, and branch_to_compare with the name of the branch you want to compare with the local branch.
